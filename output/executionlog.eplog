Exploit launched: AB-Unreal-Server
ABunreal.py

AB Unreal Server is prone to a remote buffer overflow because it fails to perform adequate boundary-checks on user-supplied data.
Successfully exploiting will allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected application.
Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial-of-service condition.

Exploit launched: Apache-Mod-JK
NOMBRE.py

Stack-based buffer overflow in the map_uri_to_worker function (native/common/jk_uri_worker_map.c) in mod_jk.so for Apache
Tomcat JK Web Server Connector 1.2.19 and 1.2.20, as used in Tomcat 4.1.34 and 5.5.20, allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code via a long URL that triggers the overflow in a URI worker map routine.

Exploit launched: Core-FTP-Server
CoreFTP.py

The vulnerability can be triggered by convincing a user to submit an overly long String for the SSH password. The buffer is unchecked,
resulting in control of the instruction pointer, allowing for arbitrary code injection.

Exploit launched: AB-Unreal-Server
ABunreal.py

        AB Unreal Server is prone to a remote buffer overflow because it fails to perform adequate boundary-checks on user-supplied data.
        Successfully exploiting will allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected application.
        Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial-of-service condition.

Exploit launched: Symantec-Endpoint-Protection-Manager
Symantec-Endpoint-Protection-Manager.py

Symantec has an http request handler called ConfigServerHandler that is programmatically 
restricted to only handle requests that come from localhost. I guess when they wrote this 
they just assumed that there was never going to be a way to send untrusted input to it 
since it was always going to be controlled by them. I base this guess on the fact that 
there is absolutely no attempt made to validate what input comes in to the 
updateReportingVersion function which shoves it directly into a SQL query unfiltered.

Exploit launched: EChat-Server-v2.5
EChat-Server-v2.5.py

        EChat Server is prone to a remote buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to perform adequate boundary-checks on user-supplied data.
        Successfully exploiting this issue will allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected application.
        Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial-of-service condition.

Easy-Chat-Server-3.1.py

Easy Chat Server contains an overflow condition that is triggered as user-supplied input is not properly validated when handling input passed 
via the 'username' parameter to the /chat.ghp script. This may allow a remote attacker to cause a buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service or potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code.

EXPLOIT DESCRIPTION: # By setting UserID in the cookie to a long string, we can overwrite EDX which # allows us to control execution flow when "call dword ptr [edx+28h]" is # executed. EDX is overwritten with an address pointing to a location on the # stack which in turn points to a NOP sled leading to the shellcode. This # address on the stack is brute forced, but doesn't take long since only the # 2nd byte is always different, so the address is always 0x01??B494.

EXPLOIT NAME: EChat-Server-v2.5
EXPLOIT TYPE: remote
EXPLOIT PLATFORM: windows
EXPLOIT DESCRIPTION:         EChat Server is prone to a remote buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to perform adequate boundary-checks on user-supplied data.        Successfully exploiting this issue will allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected application.        Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial-of-service condition.

EXPLOIT NAME: Easy-Chat-Server-3.1
EXPLOIT TYPE: remote
EXPLOIT PLATFORM: windows
EXPLOIT DESCRIPTION: Easy Chat Server contains an overflow condition that is triggered as user-supplied input is not properly validated when handling input passed via the 'username' parameter to the /chat.ghp script. This may allow a remote attacker to cause a buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service or potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code.

EXPLOIT NAME: Kolibri-Server
EXPLOIT TYPE: remote
EXPLOIT PLATFORM: windows
EXPLOIT DESCRIPTION: Kolibri v2.0 is vulnerable to a remote buffer overflow attack. By sending a malformed HEAD request, we are able to overwrite both the return address and an SEH handler. Null bytes terminate the request though,but we are able to partially overwrite with a pointer to a POP + POP + RET instruction inside kolibri.exe and gain control.

EXPLOIT NAME: KiTTY-Portable---Remote-Buffer-Overflow
EXPLOIT TYPE: clientside
EXPLOIT PLATFORM: windows
EXPLOIT DESCRIPTION: When sending a long string to the KiTTY chat server as nickname, a crash occurs. The EIP overwrite does let little roomfor exploitation (offset 54) with no more than 160 to 196 bytes for the shellcode from XP to Windows10. Using a Metasploit small shellcode such as windows/shell/reverse_ord_tcp (118 bytes encoded) makes KiTTY crashing after the first connection. We control the SEH overflow, but as all DLLs are SafeSEH protected, using an address from KiTTY itself has a NULL which forces us to jump backward with no extra space. We are jailed in a tight environment with little room to work with.

Exploit launched: Apache-Mod-JK
NOMBRE.py

Stack-based buffer overflow in the map_uri_to_worker function (native/common/jk_uri_worker_map.c) in mod_jk.so for Apache
Tomcat JK Web Server Connector 1.2.19 and 1.2.20, as used in Tomcat 4.1.34 and 5.5.20, allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code via a long URL that triggers the overflow in a URI worker map routine.

Exploit launched: Core-FTP-Server
CoreFTP.py

The vulnerability can be triggered by convincing a user to submit an overly long String for the SSH password. The buffer is unchecked,
resulting in control of the instruction pointer, allowing for arbitrary code injection.

Exploit launched: EChat-Server-v2.5
EChat-Server-v2.5.py

EChat Server is prone to a remote buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to perform adequate boundary-checks on user-supplied data.
Successfully exploiting this issue will allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected application.
Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial-of-service condition.

Exploit launched: Symantec-Endpoint-Protection-Manager
Symantec-Endpoint-Protection-Manager.py

Symantec has an http request handler called ConfigServerHandler that is programmatically 
restricted to only handle requests that come from localhost. I guess when they wrote this 
they just assumed that there was never going to be a way to send untrusted input to it 
since it was always going to be controlled by them. I base this guess on the fact that 
there is absolutely no attempt made to validate what input comes in to the 
updateReportingVersion function which shoves it directly into a SQL query unfiltered.

Exploit launched: EChat-Server-v2.5
EChat-Server-v2.5.py

        EChat Server is prone to a remote buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to perform adequate boundary-checks on user-supplied data.
        Successfully exploiting this issue will allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected application.
        Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial-of-service condition.

Exploit launched: Easy-Chat-Server-3.1
Easy-Chat-Server-3.1.py

Easy Chat Server contains an overflow condition that is triggered as user-supplied input is not properly validated when handling input passed 
via the 'username' parameter to the /chat.ghp script. This may allow a remote attacker to cause a buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service or potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code.

EXPLOIT TYPE: remote
EXPLOIT PLATFORM: windows
EXPLOIT DESCRIPTION: # By setting UserID in the cookie to a long string, we can overwrite EDX which # allows us to control execution flow when "call dword ptr [edx+28h]" is # executed. EDX is overwritten with an address pointing to a location on the # stack which in turn points to a NOP sled leading to the shellcode. This # address on the stack is brute forced, but doesn't take long since only the # 2nd byte is always different, so the address is always 0x01??B494.

EXPLOIT NAME: Easy-Chat-Server-3.1
EXPLOIT TYPE: remote
EXPLOIT PLATFORM: windows
EXPLOIT DESCRIPTION: Easy Chat Server contains an overflow condition that is triggered as user-supplied input is not properly validated when handling input passed via the 'username' parameter to the /chat.ghp script. This may allow a remote attacker to cause a buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service or potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code.

EXPLOIT NAME: EChat-Server-v2.5
EXPLOIT TYPE: remote
EXPLOIT PLATFORM: windows
EXPLOIT DESCRIPTION:         EChat Server is prone to a remote buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to perform adequate boundary-checks on user-supplied data.        Successfully exploiting this issue will allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected application.        Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial-of-service condition.

EXPLOIT NAME: Kolibri-Server
EXPLOIT TYPE: remote
EXPLOIT PLATFORM: windows
EXPLOIT DESCRIPTION: Kolibri v2.0 is vulnerable to a remote buffer overflow attack. By sending a malformed HEAD request, we are able to overwrite both the return address and an SEH handler. Null bytes terminate the request though,but we are able to partially overwrite with a pointer to a POP + POP + RET instruction inside kolibri.exe and gain control.

EXPLOIT NAME: KiTTY-Portable---Remote-Buffer-Overflow
EXPLOIT TYPE: clientside
EXPLOIT PLATFORM: windows
EXPLOIT DESCRIPTION: When sending a long string to the KiTTY chat server as nickname, a crash occurs. The EIP overwrite does let little roomfor exploitation (offset 54) with no more than 160 to 196 bytes for the shellcode from XP to Windows10. Using a Metasploit small shellcode such as windows/shell/reverse_ord_tcp (118 bytes encoded) makes KiTTY crashing after the first connection. We control the SEH overflow, but as all DLLs are SafeSEH protected, using an address from KiTTY itself has a NULL which forces us to jump backward with no extra space. We are jailed in a tight environment with little room to work with.

Using a Metasploit small shellcode such as windows/shell/reverse_ord_tcp (118 bytes encoded) makes KiTTY crashing after the first connection. We control the SEH overflow, but as all DLLs are SafeSEH protected, using an address from KiTTY itself has a NULL which forces us to jump backward with no extra space. We are jailed in a tight environment with little room to work with.

EXPLOIT NAME: VFU-4.10-1.1---Buffer-Overflow
EXPLOIT TYPE: clientside
EXPLOIT PLATFORM: linux
EXPLOIT DESCRIPTION: # VFU v4.10-1.1 is prone to a stack-based buffer overflow# vulnerability because the application fails to perform adequate# boundary-checks on user-supplied input.## An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code in the# context of the application. Failed exploit attempts will result in a# denial-of-service condition.

EXPLOIT NAME: XM-Easy-Personal-FTP-Server
EXPLOIT TYPE: remote
EXPLOIT PLATFORM: windows
EXPLOIT DESCRIPTION: # Because this address is relative and has a static base in this environment, I was able# to use the heap chunk address as the pointer to write at the vtable. Then a function is# called at offset 0xb0 or 0x98 and we can reliably return into a ROP payload and execute# arbitrary code.
