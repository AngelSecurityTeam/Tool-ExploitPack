Exploit Pack - Description


Exploit Pack has been designed by an experienced team of software developers 
and exploit writers to automate processes so penetration testers can focus 
on what's really important. The threat. This blend of software engineers and 
subject matter experts provides an unique advantage by combining technical 
know-how with true insight into the problem set, resulting in more efficient 
solutions for cyber security surveillance.


Happy hacking!

BUILD OUTPUT DESCRIPTION


When you build an Java application project that has a main class, the IDE
automatically copies all of the JAR
files on the projects classpath to your projects dist/lib folder. The IDE
also adds each of the JAR files to the Class-Path element in the application
JAR files manifest file (MANIFEST.MF).

To run the project from the command line, go to the dist folder and
type the following:

java -jar "ExploitPack.jar" 

To distribute this project, zip up the dist folder (including the lib folder)
and distribute the ZIP file.
